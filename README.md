# Android Development Lab:
All the Programs of 7th Sem Android Development Lab with their output in different steps. These programs include Android components, UI/UX design, activity lifecycle, intents, fragments, data storage, API integration, Firebase services, notifications, background tasks, and basic mobile application development.

## Introduction to RTU Android Development Lab
The Rajasthan Technical University (RTU) Android Development Lab is designed to give students practical, hands-on experience in building mobile applications using the Android platform. This lab bridges the gap between core programming concepts and real-world app development by enabling students to design, develop, and deploy Android apps using modern tools, libraries, and backend integration.

### Objectives:
-To familiarize students with essential Android components such as Activities, Fragments, Services, Broadcast Receivers, and Intents.
-To develop skills in designing responsive user interfaces using XML layouts and Material Design principles.
-To provide experience in data management using SharedPreferences, SQLite, Room Database, and internal/external storage.
-To enable students to integrate REST APIs, JSON parsing, and cloud services like Firebase Authentication and Firebase Realtime Database.
-To help students understand app lifecycle, permissions, background tasks, and best practices for building robust mobile applications.

### Lab Structure and Experiments:
The lab generally includes 10–12 experiments covering:
-Creating Android Activities and understanding the activity lifecycle.
-Designing UI screens using XML layouts and handling user interactions.
-Implementing Intents, passing data between screens, and using implicit intents.
-Working with Fragments and multi-screen interfaces.
-Performing CRUD operations using SQLite or Room Database.
-Accessing device resources such as camera, gallery, and sensors.
-Integrating REST APIs and parsing JSON data.
-Using Firebase Authentication, Firestore, or Realtime Database.
-Building background services, notifications, and foreground tasks.
-Developing a mini Android app combining multiple Android components.
Each experiment is designed to progressively enhance mobile development skills aligned with current industry practices.

### Hardware and Software Environment:
-Systems configured with Windows/Linux for Android Studio development.

-Minimum configuration: Intel i3 or higher processor, 4–8 GB RAM, 40–80 GB storage.

### Software tools include:

-Android Studio (latest stable version),Java/Kotlin (JDK 8/11), Android Emulator or physical Android devices,Firebase tools and SDKs.

-Each student is assigned a system to ensure smooth compilation, emulation, and debugging.

### Learning Outcomes:

By the end of the lab, students will be able to:

-Build Android applications using Activities, Fragments, and UI components.

-Manage data using databases, APIs, and cloud storage.

-Integrate Firebase services for authentication and data management.

-Implement background tasks, notifications, and app permissions.

-Deploy apps on emulators or real Android devices.

-Gain confidence in using Android Studio, Gradle, and Android libraries.

### Importance of the Lab:
This lab prepares students for careers in mobile application development, software engineering, and UI/UX development. Through practical exposure, students learn modern app-building techniques, backend integration, and debugging—skills highly demanded in the mobile industry.
